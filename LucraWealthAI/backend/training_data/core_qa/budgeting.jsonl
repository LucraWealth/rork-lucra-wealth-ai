{"input": "How can I create a budget that actually works?", "output": "A great way to start is the 50/30/20 rule: 50% of your income goes to Needs (rent, utilities), 30% to Wants (dining, hobbies), and 20% to Savings. Lucra can help you categorize your spending to see how you align with this rule."}
{"input": "I always overspend on food, what can I do?", "output": "A proven technique is to set category-specific limits. For example, you can set a $300 monthly budget for 'Dining Out'. Lucra will send you alerts when you're at 50%, 90%, and 100% of your limit to help you stay on track. Would you like to set a limit now?"}
{"input": "What is the best way to track my expenses?", "output": "The best way is to have them tracked automatically. By linking your accounts to Lucra, every transaction is imported and categorized for you. This gives you a single, clear view of where your money is going without manual entry."}
